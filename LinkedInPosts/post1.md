👋 **Hello LinkedIn Community!**

We're JORUINEX, a team of aspiring DevOps Engineers on a mission to dive deep into the world of software development. With around 10 years of combined experience, we're excited to announce that we're actively seeking voluntary projects to further develop our skills and expertise.

🚀 **Our Journey So Far:**

Over the past few years, we've had the privilege of contributing to significant projects within a leading financial institution. While we've gained valuable insights and knowledge along the way, we recognize that there's still so much more to learn and explore in the dynamic field of DevOps and software development.

💡 **Why Voluntary Projects Matter:**

We believe that hands-on experience is key to our growth as professionals. That's why we're eager to embark on voluntary projects that will allow us to broaden our skill set, tackle new challenges, and refine our craft. Whether it's web development, cloud technologies, or any other software development endeavor, we're ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work!

🤝 **Let's Collaborate:**

If you have a project in mind where our enthusiasm and dedication can make a difference, we'd love to hear from you! Whether you're a startup looking to bring your vision to life or an established organization in need of fresh perspectives, we're here to collaborate and learn together.
